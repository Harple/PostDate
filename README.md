# PostDate
This code is to solve a business process issue. We needed a solution to update the posting date,
due date and shipping date to the current date.  Since our business process requires us to open the page
to create the shipping label and invoice it out, this peice of code will update these feilds on the page open. 

Huge thank you to Yun Zhu (yzhum) and Erik Hougaard (hougaard) who post loads of video's and documentation for 
AL coding for Business Central.
